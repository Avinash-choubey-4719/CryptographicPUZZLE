# CryptographicPUZZLE

In the crypt-arithmetic problem, some letters are used to assign digits to it. 
Like ten different letters are holding digit values from 0 to 9 to perform arithmetic operations correctly. 
There are two words are given and another word is given an answer of addition for those two words.

As an example, we can say that two words ‘BASE’ and ‘BALL’, and the result is ‘GAMES’. 

Now if we try to add BASE and BALL by their symbolic digits, we will get the answer GAMES.
